I think this is something I struggle with - so much that my initial articulation of it (this doc was originally a bulleted list of short sentences) is not very comprehensible.

I think this includes a history of eating at fancy dinners and knowing extremely wealthy people - like C-suite executives, founders of tech companies - and not being intimidated by their presence. I\'ve had a strange and charmed life, and I understand power structures inherent in these interactions, but I get along with powerful people very well because I read a little bit of Dale Carnegie and winged the rest. (Classy.) Regarding etiquette, I had a friend who would chew with her mouth open, gnashing so loudly even through the filter of my noise-canceling headphones. I hated her for it. I think we\'re still friends, but we haven\'t spoken in months. I hope this entire paragraph is interpreted only in a semi-serious manner.',

For example, my friend said he was surprised when he got a girlfriend with his mustache and I joked with him that it might be time to shave it off - unless his girlfriend was really into it. And he went on to tell me about how she said he could grow whatever facial hair he liked as long as the mustache stayed. Charming, wholesome, and one of many very enjoyable bits. I do not do improv comedy very well, but I loved watching Whole Line Is It Anyway and know the rules of improv. I watch standup comedy semi-regularly and performing one day as a standup comedian is something on my bucket list. I have a dry sense of humor that is also influenced by many stand-up comedians from the late 20th century - George Carlin, Richard Pryor, and the like. I also enjoy Anthony Jeselnik\'s dark humor and alternative sketch comedy like SNL, Mad TV and Kids in the Hall.',

I am interested in being "out there" in the world, and the relationships I make in my career are a large part of my regular life, although I have a close inner circle of personal friends.

I have a uniquely good memory - my rate of long-term memory consolidation is very high, and I augment this with Google Calendar. I text my friends on their birthdays. When I say, "Noted" in conversation, it means that I actually made a mental or literal note and will return to that thought later. I am uniquely prepared for many situations and this has manifested itself in the form of overpacking for airplane trips by about 20 lbs. and then paring down to the essentials before I leave for the airport - portable luggage scale at the ready.',
